# TODO list

## Emulation elements

* CPU (disassembly, parsing opt-codes, etc)
* internal hardware (video, audio, A/B buses, timing)
* external hardware (controllers, video res, cartridge chips/ram)
* interaction with host computer (input, video output, sound output)

## Vague priorities 
* opt-codes
* ram
* buses (at least the general one)
* host interaction (input, video)
* internal hardware skeleton (minus timing)
   * just let the CPU write to relevant ram, doesn't need to do much right now
   * a sort of 'acknowledge and do nothing' state
* internal hardware (video)
* SNES-side external hardware skeleton
* internal hardware revamp (timing, sound)
* host interaction (audio)
* Cartridge-side external hardware (functionality)
* whatever else I am forgetting

## What's been done
* nothing
