# SNOS 
SNES emulator in C

The purpose of this project is to fully emulate the SNES system.

Over the full life of this project, if things go as planned, then the emulator will take form as a userspace program, a kernel module, and possibly eventually a stand alone OS. 

Consult `TODO.md` for the challenges of this project and my plan going forward.
