# SNOS 
SNES emulator in C

The purpose of this project is to fully emulate the SNES system.

Over the full life of this project, if things go as planned, then the emulator will take form as a userspace program, a kernel module, and possibly eventually a stand alone OS. 

Consult [trello](https://trello.com/b/onxgGM9g) for non-commit based progress.

The documentation directory contains some useful information about the snes, but is quite dense and dry.
